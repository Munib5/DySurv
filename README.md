# DySurv

The data folder contains a notebook for high-level pre-processing and data extraction of the MIMIC-IV dataset and is built on the excellent work by Rochetau in extracting time-series data from the MIMIC-IV database: https://github.com/EmmaRocheteau/TPC-LoS-prediction

The Models folder contains all the results for all the benchmarks, the DySurv model architecture, and all experiments in organised notebooks.
